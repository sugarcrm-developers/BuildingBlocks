# Package Listing
Each of these packages are ready to be built, zipped, uploaded and installed using [Module Loader](http://support.sugarcrm.com/SmartLinks/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Module_Loader/) into any existing Sugar 7 On-Demand or On-Site instance.

The `buildPackages.sh` script can be used to build all these packages easily on Unix based environments.

## [ProcessManagementDashlet](ProcessManagementDashlet/)

Serves as the starting point for adding a custom dashlet to a record view. It triggers a Sidecar API call based on the dashletâ€™s configuration, which then invokes a backend endpoint to fetch and populate data specific to the current record.

## [ProcessManagementPruner](ProcessManagementPruner/)

Serves as the starting point for building a pruner for SugarBPM and its related tables. It retrieves `pmse*` records along with their relationships and prunes them in a cascaded manner. You can also leverage [Data Archiver](https://support.sugarcrm.com/SmartLinks/administration_guide/system/data_archiver/) to support your use case.

## [HighlightField](HighlightField/)

Based on the article [Creating Custom Field Types](https://support.sugarcrm.com/SmartLinks/developer_guide/cookbook/creating_custom_fields/), in this example, we create a custom field type called "Highlightfield", which will mimic the base text field type with the added feature that the displayed text for the field will be highlighted in a color chosen when the field is created in Studio.

## [Canvas iFrame](CanvasIFrame)
This package displays an IFrame inside Sugar.

## [Contextual iFrame Dashlet](ContextualIFrameDashlet/)

iFrame dashlet that additionally will pass URL parameters with context information (record id and module name) that can be used to drive a lightweight UI integration with an external application.  Can be used as-is for a Proof of Concept or Demos and can be easily customized for additional capability.

## [Hello World Dashlet](HelloWorldDashlet/)

Good starting point for building any [Sugar Dashlet](http://support.sugarcrm.com/SmartLinks/Developer_Guide/User_Interface/Dashlets/) based integration from scratch.  Easily customizable for additional capability.

## [Custom Record View Button](CustomRecordViewButton/)

Shows how [Extensions Framework](http://support.sugarcrm.com/SmartLinks/Developer_Guide/Architecture/Extensions/) can be used to implement a custom button on a Record View without overriding any core files such as Sidecar View controllers, etc.

**Install Note:**  You may need to clear your cache after install of this package to ensure that old JavaScript is cleared out of the page.

## [Custom Record View Panel](CustomRecordViewPanel/)

Shows how [Extensions Framework](http://support.sugarcrm.com/SmartLinks/Developer_Guide/Architecture/Extensions/) can be used to implement a custom View to a Record layout without overriding any core files.

## [CssLoader](CssLoader/)
Utility package that provides a very simple API for loading CSS into the Sugar application for use in Dashlets or other custom UI components.

## [ScriptLoader](ScriptLoader/)
Utility package that provides a very simple API for loading JavaScript into the Sugar application for use in Dashlets or other custom UI components.

Includes [require.js](http://requirejs.org/) which is BSD / MIT licensed.

## [IFrameDrawerAction](IFrameDrawerAction/)

Starting point for adding a custom action to existing Sugar layouts that opens a drawer to present a custom UI within an IFrame. Currently it will pass URL parameters with context information (record id and module name) that can be used to drive a lightweight UI integration with an external application. Can be used as-is for a Proof of Concept or Demos and can be easily customized for additional capability.

## [FloatingDivAction](FloatingDivAction/)

Starting point for adding a custom action to footer that adds a floating DIV pane to the Sugar user interface. The advantage is that a floating pane does not re-render as the Sugar user navigates the application. This is a common use case for Telephony or Chat integrations.
